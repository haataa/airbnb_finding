# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, I look into Airbnb Boston Data to explore its business growth, prices, availability and ratings. The question I try to answer in this project include:
1. What’s the home availability pattern?
2. What’s the business growth trend ?
3. How price and rating relate with each other?
4. What’s the major factor that influence price and ratings?

# Result<a name="results"></a>
There were several interesting findings along the way. On business insight level, Airbnb Boston listing homes grow exponentially over the past few years because it answers to the call of middle classes. Major growth happen in middle price level home listings.

On the question of availability, majority of Boston hosts list their homes for a small portion of year, and price fluctuate together with house supplies. Major event like Boston Marathon can significantly increase house demand and drive prices up.

On the question of ratings. High prices generally means high ratings but the opposite is not true. And if a host want to earn more reviews, he/she should extend the availability

On the question of prices. Neighborhood, property type, Square feet, beds are all influencing factors.

On the question of review numbers. Availability 365 ,host acceptance rate and response rate are major positive factors.
